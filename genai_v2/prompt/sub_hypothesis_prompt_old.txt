From the given variable : {{ $json.id }} and its description : {{ $json.description }}, produce three specific, implementable alpha hypotheses (sub‑hypotheses). Each sub‑hypothesis must include:  
 - A unique, concise name (e.g., “5‑Day Price Reversion”)  
 - A one‑sentence description of the predictive rule  
 - A simple mathematical expression or pseudo‑code snippet showing how to compute the signal 

The model is encouraged to **leverage not only the provided variable**, but also its broader financial understanding of **price action (e.g., returns, volatility, moving averages)**, **volume dynamics (e.g., spikes, trends, OBV)**, and **fundamental indicators (e.g., earnings, P/E, book value)** where appropriate, in order to form richer and more predictive hypotheses. These auxiliary data can be used in combination with the main variable if relevant to enhance the predictive logic.

Ensure that:  
 - All three sub-hypotheses are novel and do not reuse names, descriptions, or logic from previous responses  
 - Each idea is clearly actionable for implementation in quant trading  

Output the result as a JSON array of objects, each with:  
{[  
  {  
    "Variable": "<{{ $json.Variable }}>",  
    "Sub_Hypothesis": "<Sub‑hypothesis Name>",  
    "Description": "<One‑sentence predictive rule>",  
    "Expression": "<Math formula or pseudo‑code>"  
  },  
  // … two more …  
]}  
Note: Only return the JSON, and don't mention the format name"
